# Class Performance Analyzer

## About Project

This project involves creating a function that takes class scores of students as input and calculates the class average score, class total score, and the class median score. It also evaluates the performance of the class based on the average mark.

## Problem Statement

Given a list of grades, the task is to calculate the class average score, class total score, and the class median score. Additionally, based on the average score, the project evaluates the performance of the class.

## Algorithm

The steps involved in this project are as follows:

1. Take input from the user (grades) until the input is "done".
2. Append each input grade to a list.
3. Calculate the average score, total score, and median score using the list of grades.
4. Print the calculated scores and corresponding performance metrics to the screen.

## Python Skills Learned

By studying and working with this code, you can improve your understanding of the following Python skills:

- Function declarations
- Loops (specifically `while` loops)
- Conditional statements (if-else statements)
- Lists and list operations
- Mathematical calculations (average, total, median)

## Usage

To use the `computegrade` function, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the class performance analyzer:
```python
    python class_performance.py
```
4. Enter the grades for each student in the class, one at a time. Type "done" when finished entering grades.
5. The program will calculate the class average score, class total score, and the class median score.
6. It will also print the performance of the class based on the average score.
