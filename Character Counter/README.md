# Character Counter

## About Project

The Character Counter is a Python code that counts the number of times a specific letter appears in a given word. This code helps improve your understanding of functions, loops, conditional statements, and user input.

## Problem Statement

The problem statement for this code is to develop a function that prompts the user to enter a word and a character. The code then counts the occurrences of the specified character within the given word.

## Steps Taken

The steps taken to implement the Character Counter code are as follows:

1. Define a function named `count()` without any parameters.
2. Prompt the user to enter a word and a character.
3. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the character's frequency.
4. Iterate through each character in the word using a `for` loop.
5. Check if the current character is equal to the specified letter.
6. If the condition is true, increment the `count` variable by 1.
7. Print the letter and its frequency in the word.

These steps ensure that users can easily determine the frequency of a specific character within a given word.

## Usage

To use the Character Counter code, follow these steps:

1. Run the script: python letter_count_in_word.py
2. Enter a word when prompted.
3. Enter a letter when prompted.
4. The program will calculate and display the frequency of the letter in the word.

Make sure to provide valid inputs to obtain accurate results.

## Python Skills Learned

Throughout the development of this code, several Python skills were acquired and honed. Some of the key skills learned during this project include:

- Defining and using functions.
- Working with user input using the input() function.
- Iterating through strings using a for loop.
- Implementing conditional statements and comparison operators.

These skills were essential in successfully implementing the Character Counter code and providing accurate results to users.
