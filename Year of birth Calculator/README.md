# Year of Birth Calculator

## About Project

The Year of Birth Calculator is a simple Python code that takes the age of the user as input and calculates their year of birth. By subtracting the age from the current year, the code provides users with their estimated year of birth.

## Problem Statement

The problem this project aims to solve is the determination of a person's birth year when their age is known. Often, in various scenarios such as data analysis, age-related calculations, or population demographics, it is necessary to infer the birth year based on the age provided. This birth year finder provides a simple and efficient solution to this problem.

## Approach

The approach taken in this project involves using the current year and the provided age to calculate the birth year. By subtracting the age from the current year, the birth year can be determined. The project utilizes Python programming language and provides a user-friendly command-line interface.

## Steps Taken

The steps taken to implement the Year of Birth Calculator are as follows:

1. Import the `datetime` module to work with dates and times.
2. Use the `input()` function to allow users to enter their age.
3. Compute the year of birth by subtracting the age from the current year.
4. Display the calculated year as the year of birth of the user.

These steps ensure that users can easily determine their birth year using the provided age.


## Python Skills Used

During the development of this project, the following Python skills were learned and applied:

* Working with dates and time in Python.
* Basic user input and output handling.
* Mathematical operations and calculations.
* Formatting and presenting data in a user-friendly manner.

By implementing this birth year finder, valuable Python programming skills were gained, providing a foundation for further learning and development in the field.
