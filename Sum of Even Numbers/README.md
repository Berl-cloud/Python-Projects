# Sum of Even Numbers

## About Project

This project consists of a Python program that is used to sum up all even numbers in a given list of numbers. The code focuses on utilizing functions, conditional statements, loops, and comparison operators.

## Problem Statement

Given a list of numbers, the task is to find the sum of all even numbers in the list.

## Algorithm

The algorithm used in this code is as follows:

1. Initialize a variable `sum_all` with the value 0.
2. Prompt the user to enter a list of numbers.
3. Convert the input string into a list of integers.
4. Iterate through each element in the list.
5. Check if the current element `num` is even by using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`).
6. If `num` is even, add it to the `sum_all` variable.
7. Repeat steps 3-4 for all elements in the list.
8. Return the final value of `sum_all` as the sum of even numbers.

## Python Skills Learned

By studying and working with this code, you can improve your understanding of the following Python skills:

- Function declarations
- Conditional statements (specifically `if` statements)
- Loops (specifically `for` loops)
- Comparison operators
- List comprehension

## Installation

No installation is required for this project. Simply copy the code and run it in a Python environment.

## Usage

To use the `sum_even` function, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the sum of even numbers program:
```bash
python sum_even.py
```
4. Enter a list of numbers separated by spaces when prompted.
5. The program will calculate the sum of even numbers in the provided list.
6. The result will be printed as "Sum of even numbers: [`sum_all`]".
