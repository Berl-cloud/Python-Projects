# Maximum Number Finder

## About Project

This project consists of a Python function that is designed to find the maximum number in a given list of numbers.

## Problem Statement

Given a list of numbers, the task is to find the largest number in the list.

## Algorithm

The algorithm used in this code is as follows:

1. Initialize a variable `max_num` with the first element of the input list.
2. Iterate through each element `num` in the list.
3. Check if the current element `num` is greater than the current maximum `max_num`.
4. If `num` is greater, update `max_num` with the value of `num`.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for all elements in the list.
6. Return the final value of `max_num` as the maximum number.

## Python Skills Learned

By studying and working with this code, you can improve your understanding of the following Python skills:

- Function declarations
- Loops (specifically `for` loops)
- List indexing

## Installation

No installation is required for this project. Simply copy the code and run it in a Python environment.

## Usage

To use the `find_max` function, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the maximum number finder.
```python
    python find_max.py
```
4. Enter the list of numbers for which you want to find the maximum number.
5. The program will print the maximum number occurring in the list.
